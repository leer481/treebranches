      TREE BRANCHES
    </div>
    <div class="text">
       Looking out of my window, I see my neighborâ€™s tree with long branches that reach across the fence that separate our properties. The branches are bare because all of the leaves have fallen due to the changing of seasons. The fallen leaves reveal the framework of the tree, all the branches weaving in and out through each other looking tangled and chaotic. From the ones I can see from my room, there seems to be some buds left over on the tips of the branches. These remind me of the last few signs of warmth before the cold sets in for the next few months.
